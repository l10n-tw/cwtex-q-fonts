Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The CM-LGC package contains Type 1 fonts converted from METAFONT
sources of the Computer Modern font families. The following encodings
are supported: T1, T2A (Cyrillic), LGR (Greek) and TS1. This package
includes also Unicode virtual fonts for use with Omega/Lambda.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions for teTeX, TeX Live,
MikTeX or VTeX/Free systems.

PLEASE read the files README and INSTALL carefully before reporting 
problems.

The goal of the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to Peter Szabo's excellent TeXtrace program it is easy
to convert METAFONT sources to the Type 1 format. There are some
Type 1 font packages based on the Computer Modern font families 
already available on the Web. I have to mention here excellent 
CM-SUPER font package by Vladimir Volovich, which covers all
European and Cyrillic writings. So you can ask me, why not to
use already existing font packages instead of making new one.
Here the reasons which made me to undertake this work one more
time:

1. All font packages designed as a replacement for METAFONT
sources try to include maximal possible number of fonts. Usually
for each size of each family and shape different pfb files
are provided. This increases the size of whole package enormously.
For example, the CM-SUPER fonts requires (with afm files) more 
than 100 Mb free disk space.

The CM-LGC package *not* replaces standard METAFONT files. 
Although it is based on the Computer Modern font families,
I renamed the font files in order to avoid name clashes. Since
CM-LGC is designed as a separate package, it includes only
minimal set of fonts, which, however, should be sufficient for 
regular work.

2. There were no publicly available font packages including
Type 1 versions of Claudio Beccari's Greek fonts. CM-LGC is
first Type 1 font package for LaTeX which supports all 
European scripts (LGC means `Latin, Greek and Cyrillic').

3. Since CM-LGC is not so huge as other CM-based font packages,
it was easy to accomplish it with Unicode virtual fonts
(*.ovf files) for Omega. CM-LGC is first free alternative font
package which may be used with Omega/Lambda.

4. Type 1 fonts converted from the METAFONT sources are usually
not suitable for use outside of TeX, since they preserve their 
TeX-specific encodings. The only exception is CM-SUPER fonts
by Vladimir Volovich, which use Unicode encoding. However,
even Unicode Type 1 fonts are useful only with Unix systems,
but not with MS Windows (under ATM).

CM-LGC is the first font package, which provides CM-like fonts
with standard (not TeX-specific) 8-bit codepages. For each font
family the following codepages are supported:

-- Adobe Standard (which, of course, is never used by itself, but
always reencoded to MICROSOFT-ANSI by ATM and to ISO8859-1 by 
XWindow system);

-- WINDOWS-1251 (Cyrillic);

-- PARATYPE-CP154 (Cyrilic Asian);

-- UNITYPE WINLANGUAGE, also known as PARATYPE-CP122 (Polytonic 
Greek).

Glyphs from the physical pfb files are combined to TeX-specific
codepages with virtual fonts, which are prepared by the same 
way, as, for example, the virtual fonts from the psnfss collection.
Of course, this means that CM-LGC lacks some rarely used glyphs,
present in the original CM fonts. However, the following TeX
codepages are fully supported: T1, T2A and LGR.

Font Naming System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the CM-LGC fonts are designed to be suitable for use in
WYSIWYG applications under MS Windows (with ATM) or X-Window
system, it was necessary to provide meaningful names for them.
Here the elements used to build the PostScript font names for
each font family and shape:

-- the font family itself (CMRoman/CMSans/CMTypewriter);

-- the script name for non-Latin fonts (Cyrillic, Asian (for
Asian Cyrillic) or Greek);

-- the font weight and shape (Regular/Italic/Bold/BoldItalic).
The CMSans font family includes "Slanted" shape instead of
"Italic" and "BoldSlanted" instead of "BoldItalic";

-- the last name element is the "SC" letters for small caps
fonts or the "OsF" letters for italic fonts with old style 
numerals.

Font File Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The font files are named according to Karl Berry's font naming 
scheme, usually used in TeX for Type 1 fonts. The first
letter, which should represent a font foundry, is always
`f' (i. e. `free'/public). Next two letters are font family 
codes. I used `cm' for "Computer Modern", `cs' for "Computer
Modern Sans" and `ct' for "Computer Modern Typewriter.

The fourth and fifth letters in the font name correspond to 
font weight and shape. Here the list of font weights and shapes 
available in the CM-LGC fonts:

r	Regular;
ri	Regular Italic;
ro	Regular Slanted;
rc	Regular Small Caps;
b	Bold;
bi	Bold Italic;
bo	Bold Slanted;
bc	Bold Small Caps.

Next letter may represent a font variant. I used `j' for
Italic fonts with Old Style digits.

The last two letters in the font name represent font encodings.
This part is the mos problematic, since there are no standard 
conventions determining which letters should be used for Cyrillic 
or Greek encodings. Here the list of font encodings used in
CM-LGC fonts:

8a	Adobe Standard;
8r	Latin raw font encoding (which, however, is slightly
	different from standard 8r);
8t	Latin TeX font encoding, i. e. T1;
6z	Cyrillic raw font encoding (windows-1251);
6y	Asian Cyrillic raw font encoding (paratype-cp1254);
6a	Cyrillic TeX font encoding, i. e. T2A;
pg	Greek raw font encoding (paratype-cp122);
gr	Greek TeX font encoding (LGR);
ut	Unicode-based encoding for Omega's ovf
	files (UT1).
	
For example, the font name `fctrijpg.pfb' means "Computer 
Modern Typewriter font with regular weight and italic shape, 
containing old style numerals and using the Greek 
paratype-cp122 codepage".

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the INSTALL file for installation instrustions.

Using CM-LGC with LaTeX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just put in your LaTeX preamble the following line:

\usepackage{cmlgc}

This will set you default Roman font to fcm, your Sans Serif
font to fcs, and your Typewriter font to fct.

Using CM-LGC with Omega/Lambda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately, last Omega releases doesn't provide any
high-level commands for working with multilingual document.
That's why I provided alternative language support package
for Omega, called ANTOMEGA.

Note that the Unicode virtual fonts, included in the CM-LGC
package, are not fully compatible with Yannis Haralambous'
omlgc font (which really uses a font-specific encoding).
ANTOMEGA provides special features for handling strict Unicode
fonts, and using it instead of the standard omega.sty file
is strongly recommended.

The CM-LGC package includes antcmlgc.sty file, designed 
specially for ANTOMEGA. If you use both ANTOMEGA and CM-LGC,
load it in your preamble instead of cmlgc.sty.

Thanks
~~~~~~

I'd like to thank Peter Szabo for TeXtrace, Martin Weber for
AutoTrace, and George Williams for his escellent pfaedit program,
which I used for optimizing Type 1 font files.

Happy TeXing!
